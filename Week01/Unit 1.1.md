Digital economy, also called Web Economy, is a term used to refer to the economic activity fostered by society and business sectors to boost productivity and improve life quality through continuous process innovation using technology and digital services.
Many believe that the world's first digital transformation began in 1844 when the first telegram was sent. However, the term "Digital Economy" appeared until 1995 in the best-seller The Digital Economy: Rethinking Promise and Peril in the Age of Networked Intelligence by Don Tapscott.
This book was revolutionary because it was one of the first ones to present the change that businesses would undergo thanks to the internet. The Internet has represented a change in the economy, providing a global platform that has allowed people, companies and organizations to interact, exchange information, collaborate and communicate.

Nowadays, half of the world's population is online, which means that half of the world regardless of geography, race or age is in a new environment where physical barriers to communication can be more easily removed. All this connectivity has originated in the digital economy, a dynamic technology-based environment, a massive supply of information, and increasingly inclusive systems.


Since the beginning of the industrial revolution, four eras have been marked that have historically impacted both industry and the economy and society:

Industry 1.0 - Mechanical (1784): during this era stands out the creation of steam engines that became a new source of energy and transport through the invention of the railway, as well as machines were little by little taking more importance in industry and society.

Industry 2.0 - Electrical (1870): Considered by many as one of the revolutions with the greatest impact, this new era was marked by the emergence of new sources of energy that are still in force today: electricity, oil and gas; Furthermore, internal combustion engine was gaining strength in the industry.

This era also began a new start in society with important changes in the way of communicating through the appearance of new methods such as telegraph and telephone, in addition to the beginning of two mode of transport: automobile and airplane.

Industry 3.0- Electronic (1969): During this era the industry received an impact thanks to the appearance of robots and Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC) initiating high-level automation. While the first two eras focused on scalable efficiency, scalable adaptability began from here.
The social impact during this era was tremendous with the importance that was given to searching for knowledge with the beginning of research and space exploration programs. In addition, computers, telecommunications and electronics appeared in this era.
The energy that represented this era was nuclear energy.

Industry 4.0 - Digital (Now)
Industry 4.0 is considered as an industry whose magnitude of impact is not yet fully known because it is happening right now.
What marked the beginning of this era was an invention that unleashed a total change in communication, economy, education, industry, and many more social and economic spheres: the Internet.
While the first three eras concentrated on empowering corporations, this era stands out for empowering people. The appearance of Cyber Physical Systems, automated complex tasks, Internet of Things (IOT) and Data networks revolutionized the industry.


It is possible to think each revolution is composed of two economic periods: the installation period and the deployment period.

The installation period refers to the moment when the innovations of the beginning of a new revolution emerge, begin to be adopted by industries and society in general, experiment with them and speculate around them, generating a kind of bubble that when it bursts begins an economic crisis that gives way to the next period.

The unfolding period is when, after the collapse, everything begins to transform, rebuild and stabilize. Experimentation and failed tests allow lessons to be learned that will be established and accepted as more reliable paradigms and models than their predecessors, allowing better use of innovations.

Currently, during these crises, information and communication technologies (ICT) have been very helpful by serving as disseminators of increasingly available information, allowing developing countries, for example, to be able to intervene more in their own social development and development. economic.

Also, these technologies allow the collection, analysis and sharing of relevant data for the economy that better allow the quality of life, the environment and working conditions.

Thinking about the next revolution in productivity, the emphasis that is currently being placed on innovation is very obvious. While in the past economic growth was supported by environmental resources and human labor, today the government has realized over the years how the environment is increasingly precarious and the young population has been reducing. So, investments have been concentrated on innovation.
