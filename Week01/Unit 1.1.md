Digital economy, also called Web Economy, is a term used to refer to the economic activity fostered by society and business sectors to boost productivity and improve life quality through continuous process innovation using technology and digital services.
Many believe that the world's first digital transformation began in 1844 when the first telegram was sent. However, the term "Digital Economy" appeared until 1995 in the best-seller The Digital Economy: Rethinking Promise and Peril in the Age of Networked Intelligence by Don Tapscott.
This book was revolutionary because it was one of the first ones to present the change that businesses would undergo thanks to the internet. The Internet has represented a change in the economy, providing a global platform that has allowed people, companies and organizations to interact, exchange information, collaborate and communicate.
