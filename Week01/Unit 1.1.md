Digital economy, also called Web Economy, is a term used to refer to the economic activity fostered by society and business sectors to boost productivity and improve life quality through continuous process innovation using technology and digital services.
Many believe that the world's first digital transformation began in 1844 when the first telegram was sent. However, the term "Digital Economy" appeared until 1995 in the best-seller The Digital Economy: Rethinking Promise and Peril in the Age of Networked Intelligence by Don Tapscott.
This book was revolutionary because it was one of the first ones to present the change that businesses would undergo thanks to the internet. The Internet has represented a change in the economy, providing a global platform that has allowed people, companies and organizations to interact, exchange information, collaborate and communicate.

Industry 2.0 - Electrical (1870): Considered by many as one of the revolutions with the greatest impact, this new era was marked by the emergence of new sources of energy that are still in force today: electricity, oil and gas; Furthermore, internal combustion engine was gaining strength in the industry.
This era also began a new start in society with important changes in the way of communicating through the appearance of new methods such as telegraph and telephone, in addition to the beginning of two mode of transport: automobile and airplane.

Industry 3.0- Electronic (1969): During this era the industry received an impact thanks to the appearance of robots and Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC) initiating high-level automation. While the first two eras focused on scalable efficiency, scalable adaptability began from here.
The social impact during this era was tremendous with the importance that was given to searching for knowledge with the beginning of research and space exploration programs. In addition, computers, telecommunications and electronics appeared in this era.
The energy that represented this era was nuclear energy.

Industry 4.0 - Digital (Now)
Industry 4.0 is considered as an industry whose magnitude of impact is not yet fully known because it is happening right now.
What marked the beginning of this era was an invention that unleashed a total change in communication, economy, education, industry, and many more social and economic spheres: the Internet.
